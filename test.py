Rationing the US and keeping profits high.Excepts from the chapter - the whole chapter is available to download for a small feeIt was not just gem quality diamonds that De Beers wanted to pump into the wartime America of the 1940s. It's warehouses stores contained literally tonnes of 'industrial diamonds' that were either too flawed, too small or of too poor a shape to be quite as easy easily to cut as glittering gems. These were locked away in De Beers vaults lest they be used to create cheaper diamond jewelry. But, as America came out of depression, De Beers found a rapidly growing market in factories for these poorer diamonds . It sold them as diamond tool stones for a few dollars each, while at the same time supervising their use to ensure that these diamonds were used as tools and not jewels.In the 1930s mass production techniques created such a great demand for diamond tipped cutting tools that industrial diamonds once thought worthless became worth more per gram than gold. Ernest Oppenheimer put his brother Otto in charge of selling diamonds to the military machines of all parties as war grew nearer. Once war broke out in Europe, De Beers turned increasingly to the American market as the United States in turn prepared for war...... the United States was critically short of the diamonds needed to arm itself and its allies. The Arkansas deposit was not being mined and there was no other source of diamonds in the US. Nevertheless, However, given the enormous number the Syndicate had in its London vaults, it should have been relatively easy for the United States to get the diamonds it needed as long as the Atlantic trading routes were not closed by the German U-boats. . In 1939 the US Justice Department estimated De Beers held 40 million carats, eight tonnes of diamonds. Other estimates were still higher. A British Go.< EOM >",
