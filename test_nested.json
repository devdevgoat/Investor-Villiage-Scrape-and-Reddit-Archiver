The comment that \"There is no guarantee that further exploration or drilling will produce any economic benefit to the Company or the shareholders of the Company.\" is too funny.  No kidding.   They forgot to add \"whatsoever\" to the end of the statement.  With that being said, I am planning on buying 5 million shares tomorrow.  What the hell.  If they find diamonds, I guess I will make a ton of money.  If not, I lose 500 dollars.  I see no risk here, so I am in.  Does anyone have any idea what the float is?  They are retiring billions of shares, and I can only speculate on how many total outstanding shares there are.  Good pick, who's idea was it to add this stock to the forums?As an aside, I tried to put in a buy order for this stock on Scottrade, and got rejected with a message, \"No bid or ask found for this security.  Contact your local branch.\"  Did anyone else have problems buying stock in this company?< EOM >",
